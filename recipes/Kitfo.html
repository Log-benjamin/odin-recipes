            <img src="Image folder/Kitfo.jpg" alt="Image of Kitfo" >
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Made from the leanest meat, kitfo is viewed as a big treat by ordinary Ethiopians, while its nutritional powers are also praised.</p>

            <p>Similar to French steak tartare, the meat is minced and warmed in a pan with a little butter, mitmita (a stronger version of berbere) and sometimes thyme. Kitfo is typically served leb leb (warmed, not cooked), though you can ask for it to be betam leb leb ("very warmed," which basically means cooked).</p>

            <p>
                Kitfo can be served with aib (like dry cottage cheese) and gomen (minced spinach), a recommended pairing making the meal even more delicious, as well as especially filling -- highly recommended after a hard day's traveling or if one is confronted with a hangover after a long night.

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <li>Beef filet – well-trimmed
                    <ol>
                        <li>Set out a large high-powered food processor. Make sure to trim all the silver skin and fat off the fillet and cut the fillet into large chunks. Place in the food processor.</li>
                        <li>Add the cayenne, salt, anchovy paste, garlic powder, and cardamom. Pulse to chop the fillet into fine chunks. You can choose to stop when the beef resembles ¼ inch chunks, or chop smaller into ground steak.</li>
                        <li>Once the texture is to your liking, melt the clarified butter and pour over the top. Mix the butter in by hand, do not pulse. </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Anchovy paste – for a unique salty and savory flavor
                    <ol>
                        <li>Serve the freshly prepared steak tartare room temperature, or seal in a container and refrigerate for 30 minutes (or more) to enjoy cold.</li>
                        <li>If you are enjoying with other hot dishes, I recommend you serve without refrigerating for the perfect mouth-feel combination.</li>
