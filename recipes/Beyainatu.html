            <h2>Description</h2>
            
            <p>The name of Ethiopia's most popular vegetarian dish translates as "a bit of every type," hence your injera arrives blanketed in piles of tasty and colorful vegetables, potatoes, curries, lentil stews and more, creating a riot of colors and tastes.</p>

            <p>Due to Ethiopia's strong tradition of religious fasting and abstaining from meat on Wednesdays and Fridays, beyainatu is widely available around the country, and served just about everywhere from fancy hotels to tiny food shacks beside the road. Hence when traveling or faced with a menu only printed in Amharic, beyainatu is a safe and simple go-to.</p>

                        <li>My personal favourite dish is intensely spiced, thanks to Ethiopia’s complex and fiery spice blend, berbere. It’s sold in Ethiopian grocers, but I buy mine at Mister Greek Meat Market (801 Danforth, west of Jones Ave.).
