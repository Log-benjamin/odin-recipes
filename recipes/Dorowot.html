            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Wot is Ethiopia's version of curry, and the ubiquitous companion of injera. While beef and goat are often used with wot, chicken -- doro in Amharic -- reigns as the wot champion.</p>

            <p>Doro wot is made with chicken drumsticks or wings cooked and served in a hot sauce of butter, onion, chilli, cardamom and berbere. In the midst of this stew incongruously bobs a hard-boiled egg. It proves a delicious accompaniment -- typically offered to a guest as a sign of respect.</p>

            <p>For Ethiopians, doro wot is the go-to meal of celebration during national and religious festivals (the day before, women can be seen everywhere carrying upside-down clucking chickens by their feet).</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            
            <ul>
                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <li>Niter Kibbeh (Ethiopian Spiced Butter)
                    <ol>
                        <li>Combine the lemon juice and salt in a large, nonreactive mixing bowl and stir until slightly dissolved. Add the chicken thighs, one at a time, dipping both sides of each piece in the marinade to coat. Cover and allow to marinate in the refrigerator for about 30 minutes.</li>
                        <li>While the chicken is marinating, purée the onions, garlic and ginger in a food processor or blender. Add a little water, if necessary, to get the blades moving.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Injera (Fermented Sourdough Bread)
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat the butter in a Dutch oven over medium heat and stir in the paprika to color the oil. Stir in the berbere paste and cook for 3 minutes, until heated through. Add the onion mixture and sauté until most of the moisture evaporates and the mixture reduces, about 15 minutes.</li>
                        <li>Pour in the stock and wine, add cayenne to taste and season with salt and pepper. Remove the chicken from the lemon juice and discard the marinade. Add the chicken to the pot and cover with sauce. Bring the sauce to a boil, reduce the heat to low, cover and simmer for 45 minutes, flipping the chicken halfway through. Add water, if necessary, to maintain the liquid level.</li>
                        <li>dd the whole hard-boiled eggs and continue to cook until the chicken is very tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Adjust seasoning and serve hot with injera bread or rice.</li>
