            <h2>Description</h2>

            <p>Sliced beef or lamb, pan-fried in butter, garlic and onion, tibs is one of the most popular dishes among Ethiopians.</p>

            <p>It comes in a variety of forms, varying in type, size or shape of the cuts of meat used, and can range from hot to mild or contain little to no vegetables. A particularly recommended variation is shekla tibs, in which the strips of meat arrive at your table roasting atop a clay pot stoked with hot coals -- dramatic and delicious.</p>

            <p>Historically, tibs was served to pay a compliment or show respect to someone. Today it's still viewed as a special dish, hence its popularity for commemorating special events and holidays. At the same time, though, if you walk into a rowdy bar on a Friday afternoon in Ethiopia's rambunctious capital, Addis Ababa, it's likely that most of the revelers will be enthusiastically ordering and eating tibs.</p>

            <p>Typically, the meat of the tibs that arrives at your table has just been cleaved from carcasses hanging outside beside the restaurant's entrance. Don't be put off; meat rarely comes fresher or tastier.</p>

            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <h4>Steps</h4>

                <li>cubed flat-iron steak
                    <ol>
                        <li>Start with the sauce by adding the tomatoes and onions to a pan and cook on medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, until soft</li>
                        <li>Then add 2 tablespoons of oil and the berbere. Turn the heat to low and simmer for about 5 minutes</li>
                        <li>Next, add the garlic and simmer for 2 more minutes</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>tablespoon berbere
                    <ol>
                        <li>The last step for the sauce is to add ½ teaspoon of salt and the black cardamom or black pepper</li>
                        <li>In a separate pan, heat 1 tablespoon of oil on medium-high heat, then add the meat</li>
                        <li>Sprinkle the meat with ½ teaspoon of salt and cook for 2 to 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                
                <li>roma tomato, cut in wedges
                    <ol>
                        <li>Move the meat to the pan with the berbere sauce. Cook until done, about 8-10 minutes.</li>
                        <li>To get the best flavor, use the freshest meat you can get.</li>
                        <li>Try to find a local butcher, ranch, or farm that sells high-quality, locally raised beef. It makes a difference.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

                <li>ground black cardamom or black pepper to taste
                    <ol>
                        <li>When I am making stews, I don’t mind getting stew beef from the grocery store.</li>
                        <li>The meat cooks in spices for a long time and takes on the flavor of the sauce. </li>
                        <li>Because tibs is a quick-cooking stir fry, better quality meat will make your dish taste better. If you are using any other meat cut than the flank steak, make sure it is tender meat.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
